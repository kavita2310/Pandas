<h1>Data Manipulation and Analysis using Pandas</h1>

<h1>Objective:</h1>

Demonstrate proficiency in using NumPy, Pnadas for data manipulation, analysis and visualization.

<h1>Tasks:</h1>

•	Data cleaning and Preparation:<br>
1.	Create a student  DataFrame from a specified dictionary data.<br>
2.	Join the two  dataframes of employee_1 and employee_2.<br>
3.	Write a Pandas program to join (left join) the two dataframes using keys from left dataframe only.<br>

•	Data Manipulation:<br>
1.	Add, subtract, multiple and divide two series of Pandas.<br>
2.	Compare the elements of the two Pandas Series.<br>
3.	Convert a dictionary to a Pandas series.<br>
4.	Convert a NumPy array to a Pandas series.<br>
5.	Create a sereis then add some data to an existing Series.<br>
6.	Find the mean and standard deviation of a given Series.<br>

•	Data Analysis and visualization:<br>
1.	Select the 'name' and 'Grade' columns from Student dataframe.<br>
2.	Get the first 3 rows from Student dataframe.<br>
3.	Select the rows where the number of Grade is greater than 8 from Student dataframe.<br>
4.	Change the Grade in row D to 8.3 from Student dataframe.<br>
5.	Calculate the sum and mean of Grade by the students. from Student dataframe.<br>
6.	Sort the data frame first by 'Name' in descending order, then by 'Grade' in ascending order in Student dataframe.<br>
7.	Replace the eligibility column contains the values 'eligibility' and 'Not eligible' with YES and NO.<br>
